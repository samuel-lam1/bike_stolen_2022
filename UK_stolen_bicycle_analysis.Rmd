# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Background
Bicycle is now one of the most important transportation tools in the world in terms of its cost-saving, environmental-friendly nature, as well as its advantages on health. The benefits are exceptionally considerable when it comes to the problem of energy shortage.

During the nearly 5 years of cycling to school when I was young, I was fortunate enough the bicycle never got stolen. While there were a few times it's obvious someone attempted to break the chain lock but failed. I can definitely understand how frustrated the owners would be if their bicycles got stolen. It is understandable that many bicycles may not value much and police may not put in too much resources to investigate each case (But make no mistake, some bicycles with expensive gears could cost over 10,000 pounds).

With the powerful internet resources nowadays, owners of bicycles can now report their lost on different websites with an extra hope for recovery. One of these in the UK is the [Stolen Bikes UK](https://stolen-bikes.co.uk). Thanks to the hard work of the founder John Moss, the website now contains more than 50,000 reported stolen bicycles across the UK since year 2012. It is encouraging when some of the reported stolen bicycles had been recovered. The website also provides data on some bicycle thefts in which the owners did not report to the police.

As one may notice that there is already official statistics provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS, the UK recognized national statistical institute), which is available [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/natureofcrimebicycletheft). Currently the latest available dataset is the "Year ending March 2020 edition of this dataset", which means that there is a time gap between the official statistics and the recent situation.

The aim of this analysis is to provide an overview across the past three years from 1st November 2019 to 31st October 2022, and to reveal any possible trend or pattern of the thefts and other insightful information.

All the data preparation, processing, analysis and visualization will be done in R Programming with R Studio.
<br>
<br>

## 1.2 Terminology and definitions
* Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) areas: The 12 areas of NUTS level 1 (hereinafter referred to as "regions") in this document follows the standard in [the Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/eurostat).

* Seasons definition is used according to the meteorological calendar from the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/learn-about/weather/seasons/spring/when-does-spring-start), which is defined as: spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), autumn (September, October, November), and winter (December, January, February).
<br>
<br>

# 2. Data Preparation

## 2.1 Data Source
* Stolen Bikes UK, <https://stolen-bikes.co.uk>

* The region (except Scotland) populations were obtained from the Census 2021 result from the Office for National Statistics and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency: <https://www.ons.gov.uk/census>

* Scotland population estimation was obtained from the Office for National Statistics, as result from Scotland's Census 2022 is not yet available. Please click [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/mid2020) for information.
<br>
<br>

## 2.2 Method of data collection
* R programming is used for convenient and efficient data manipulation. High quality visualization could also be generated at the same time.

* Web Scraping was used in this [webpage](https://stolen-bikes.co.uk/stolen-bikes/). There are two levels of data. The first level contains a thumbnail list of 12 bicycle thefts per page, with some basic information of each case. The second level is accessed when clicking into each case, with more detailed information provided.

* To avoid unnecessary traffic on the website, it is observed that for thefts occurring after 1st November 2019, it sits at page 1690 (with the most recent case in page 1 and in total 4300 pages).
<br>
<br>

## 2.3 Data limitations
* Sample size: since there are also other similar websites for reporting, the dataset cannot represent a full picture of all internet-reported bicycle thefts.

* Data format: some of the data were input by bicycle owners' typing but not from selection fields, which resulted in inconsistent data format. For instance, inconsistent date format, and date with/without time or time only. Data processing could not fully retrieve all the data in a useful way for analysis.
<br>
<br>

## 2.4 Data collection
### 2.4.1 Libraries loading
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
```
<br>
<br>

### 2.4.2 Web Scraping
```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
url = "https://stolen-bikes.co.uk/stolen-bikes/page/%d/"

#For 3 years data, it ends at page 1690
stolen <- map_df(1:1690, function(i) {
  page <- read_html(sprintf(url, i))
  
#Create temporary variable for the next step
  temp_bike <- page %>%
    html_nodes("h3") %>% html_text()
  
  temp_location <- page %>%
    html_nodes(".listmeta") %>% html_nodes("a") %>% html_text()
  
  temp_link <- page %>%
    html_nodes("h3") %>% html_nodes("a") %>% html_attr("href")
  
#Extract details from the 2nd level of the website
  temp_details <- as.character(lapply(temp_link, function(x)
    x %>% read_html() %>% html_nodes(".bikemeta") %>% html_text()))
  
  temp_bike_des <- as.character(lapply(temp_link, function(x)
    x %>% read_html() %>% html_nodes(".bikedescription") %>% html_text()))
  
  temp_theft_des <- as.character(lapply(temp_link, function(x)
    x %>% read_html() %>% html_nodes(".theftdescription") %>% html_text()))
  
  tibble(
    bike_name = temp_bike[1:(length(temp_bike) - 3)],
    location1 = temp_location[seq(1, length(temp_location), 2)],
    location2 = temp_location[seq(2, length(temp_location), 2)],
    link = temp_link,
    details = temp_details,
    bike_des = temp_bike_des,
    theft_des = temp_theft_des
  )
})

#Save and keep the original dataset
write_csv(stolen, "bike_stolen.csv")
```
* It took a few hours to finish the web scraping as there were 1,690 level 1 pages, and 1,690 * 12 = 20,280 level 2 pages.
<br>
<br>

# 3. Data Processing (Cleaning and transformation)
## 3.1 Checking of duplicate rows
* Check for any duplicate rows due to the long time web scraping and possibly update of the web pages.
* Use a new variable "stolen2" for data cleaning, transformation and analysis, hold the original variable "stolen" for comparison in case it is needed.
```{r, warning=FALSE}

stolen2 <- read_csv("bike_stolen.csv")

stolen2[duplicated(stolen2), ]
stolen2 <- stolen2[!duplicated(stolen2), ]
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.2 Character encoding
* Convert all characters to "UTF-8" encoding.
```{r warning=FALSE}
for (i in 1:7) {
  stolen2[, i] <-
    sapply(stolen2[, i], iconv, from = "UTF-8", to = "UTF-8", sub = " ")
}
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.3 Data columns split
* As observed from the head and tail rows, the column "details" contains 6 data elements separated by "\\n", which are:
  * Colour
  * Frame number
  * Stolen date
  * Stolen location
  * Crime reference number
  * Reward if it is recovered
* Split them into different columns.
* There is an extra column created after the last "\\n", thus the "extra" column is also created for that.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
head(stolen2$details)
tail(stolen2$details)

stolen2 <-
  separate(stolen2, col = details, into = c("colour", "frame_number", "location",
    "date_time", "crime_ref_num", "reward_GBP", "extra"), sep = "\\n")
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.4 Unnecessary columns removal
* Content of the column "location" is the same as "location1" and "location2", thus it is removed.
```{r warning=FALSE}
stolen2 <- subset(stolen2, select = -location)
```

* Check if the "extra" column is empty/<NA>/NULL, delete the column if TRUE.
```{r, warning=FALSE}

all(is.na(stolen2$extra) |
      stolen2$extra == "" | is.null(stolen2$extra) | is.na(stolen2$extra))
stolen2 <- subset(stolen2, select = -extra)
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5 Data cleaning for remaining columns
### 3.5.1 Unnecessary characters removal
* Remove the column names that appear in the columns' values.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2$colour <- sub("Colour", "", stolen2$colour)
stolen2$frame_number <- sub("Frame Number", "", stolen2$frame_number)
stolen2$date_time <- sub("Stolen When", "", stolen2$date_time)
stolen2$crime_ref_num <- sub("Crime Reference Number", "", stolen2$crime_ref_num)
stolen2$reward_GBP <- sub("Reward", "", stolen2$reward_GBP)
stolen2$bike_des <- sub("Bike Description", "", stolen2$bike_des)
stolen2$theft_des <- sub("Theft Description", "", stolen2$theft_des)
```

* Trim white space.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
for (i in 1:11) {
  stolen2[, i] <- lapply(stolen2[, i], str_squish)
}
```
<br>
<br>

### 3.5.2 "colour" column cleaning
* Remove any single letter and non-letter of the "colour" column.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2$colour <- tolower(stolen2$colour)
stolen2$colour <- gsub("[^[:alpha:]]|*\\b[[:alpha:]]\\b*", " ", stolen2$colour)
```
<br>
<br>

### 3.5.3 "location1" and "location2" columns cleaning
* Clean the location1 and location2 based on the UK regions (NUTS 1 areas).
```{r, warning=FALSE}
nuts1 <- c("North East", "North West", "Yorkshire and The Humber", "East Midlands",
           "West Midlands", "East of England", "London", "South East", "South West",
           "Scotland", "Wales", "Northern Ireland")
```

* It is observed that the following "location2" values don't match the region list.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2[!tolower(stolen2$location2) %in% tolower(nuts1), "location2"]
```

* While the "location1" in those rows all match the region list, which indicates location1 and location2 were input in the wrong order.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
all(pull(stolen2[!tolower(stolen2$location2) %in% tolower(nuts1), "location1"]) %in% nuts1)
```

* Swap the values of "location1" and "location2" in those rows.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2[!(tolower(stolen2$location2) %in% tolower(nuts1)), c("location2", "location1")] <-
  stolen2[!(tolower(stolen2$location2) %in% tolower(nuts1)), c("location1", "location2")]
```

* " (England)" is added after the following regions, and columns are renamed.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
location_add <-
  c("North East", "North West", "East Midlands", "West Midlands", "South East",
    "South West")

stolen2[stolen2$location2 %in% location_add, "location2"] <-
  paste(pull(stolen2[stolen2$location2 %in% location_add, "location2"]), "(England)")
```

* Rename the columns for a more readable name.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2 <- stolen2 %>% rename(region = location2, city = location1)
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.4 Missing values
* Fill in the missing values with "0" or "Unknown".
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2$frame_number[stolen2$frame_number == ""] <- "Unknown"
stolen2$crime_ref_num[stolen2$crime_ref_num == ""] <- "Unknown"
stolen2$reward_GBP[stolen2$reward_GBP == ""] <- 0
stolen2$theft_des[stolen2$theft_des == "character(0)"] <- "Unknown"
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.5 "date_time" column cleaning
* Remove the time in am or pm as most of the values don't contain time.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2$date_time[str_detect(stolen2$date_time, "\\s?[-:0-9.]+\\s*[ap]\\.?m\\.?") &
                    !is.na(stolen2$date_time)] <-
  stolen2$date_time[str_detect(stolen2$date_time, "\\s?[-:0-9.]+\\s*[ap]\\.?m\\.?") &
                      !is.na(stolen2$date_time)] %>%
  gsub("\\s?[-:0-9.]+\\s*[ap]\\.?m\\.?", "--", .)
```

* Convert the "date_time" column's values into standard format.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2$date_time[!is.na(dmy(stolen2$date_time))] <-
  dmy(stolen2$date_time)[!is.na(dmy(stolen2$date_time))] %>% as.character()
```

* Use the "as_date()" function to try converting the remaining values, save the results into a new column. The unconverted values remain in the "date_time" column for reference.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2 <- stolen2 %>% mutate(date = as_date(stolen2$date_time))
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.6 "reward_GBP" column cleaning
* Extract numbers from the string.
```{r, warning=FALSE}

stolen2$reward_GBP <- parse_number(stolen2$reward_GBP)
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.7 bike_des" (bike description) and the "theft_des" (theft description) columns cleaning
* Remove the html tags.
```{r, warning=FALSE}

stolen2$bike_des <- gsub("<[^>]+>", " ", stolen2$bike_des)
stolen2$theft_des <- gsub("<[^>]+>", " ", stolen2$theft_des)
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.8 Columns reorder
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2 <- stolen2[, c(1, 5, 6, 12, 7, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 4)]
```
<br>
<br>

## 3.5.9 Cleaned dataset saving
```{r eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
write_csv(stolen2, "bike_stolen_clean.csv")
```
<br>
<br>

# 4. Data analysis and visualization
## 4.1 Number of bicycle theft by time
The following section will examine the number of bicycle thefts based on different time dimensions, from year and then narrow down to day.

### 4.1.1 Number of bicycle theft by year
```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
year_count <- tibble(
  year = c("2019-11-01 ~ 2020-10-31", "2020-11-01 ~ 2021-10-31", "2021-11-01 ~ 2022-10-31"),
  freq = c(pull(stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2019-11-01", date <= "2020-10-31") %>% count()),
            pull(stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2020-11-01", date <= "2021-10-31") %>% count()),
            pull(stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2021-11-01", date <= "2022-10-31") %>% count())))

year_count %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, y = freq, fill = freq)) +
  geom_col() + geom_text(aes(label = freq), size = 10, position = position_stack(vjust = .5), alpha = .7) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Total number of bicycle theft by year",
       subtitle = "from 1st November 2019 to 31st October 2022",
       caption = "Data source: Stolen Bikes UK") +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("#2b5c8a", "goldenrod1", "#9e3d22")) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  theme_minimal() + theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "none",
                          plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
                          axis.text.y=element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(),
                          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```

* It is observed that the total number decreases 14% in the second year from 4,141 to 3,564, and a further 17% reduction from 3,564 to 2,957 in the third year.


```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2019-11-01", date <= "2022-10-31") %>% count(date)%>% 
  mutate(year = case_when(date >= "2019-11-01" & date <= "2020-10-31" ~ "2019-11-01 ~ 2020-10-31",
                          date >= "2020-11-01" & date <= "2021-10-31" ~ "2020-11-01 ~ 2021-10-31",
                          date >= "2021-11-01" & date <= "2022-10-31" ~ "2021-11-01 ~ 2022-10-31")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = str_wrap(year,10), y = n, fill = year)) + geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#9e3d22", "goldenrod1", "#2b5c8a")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Daily number of bicycle theft by year",
       subtitle = "from 1st November 2019 to 31st October 2022",
       caption = "Data source: Stolen Bikes UK") +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,1)) +
  theme_minimal() + theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "none",
                          plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
                          panel.grid = element_blank(),
                          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```

* When looking into the daily number in each year, there are also falling trends for all the maximum (from 30 cases a day to near 20), median (from above 10 cases to below 10), and majority number of cases.
<br>
<br>

### 4.1.2 Number of bicycle theft by season
```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
stolen2 <-
  stolen2 %>% mutate(
    season = case_when(
      between(month(date), 3, 5) ~ "Spring",
      between(month(date), 6, 8) ~ "Summer",
      between(month(date), 9, 11) ~ "Autumn",
      month(date) %in% c(12, 1, 2) ~ "Winter"
    ) )

stolen2$season <-
  factor(stolen2$season, levels = c("Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter"))

stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2019-11-01", date <= "2022-10-31") %>% 
  count(season) %>% ggplot(aes(x = season, y= n, fill = n)) + geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), size = 10, position = position_stack(vjust = .5), alpha = .7) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("#2b5c8a", "goldenrod1", "#9e3d22")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Total number of bicycle theft by season",
       subtitle = "From 1st November 2019 to 31st October 2022",
       caption = "Data source: Stolen Bikes UK") +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0, 0)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,1)) +
  theme_minimal() + theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "none",
                          plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
                          axis.text.y=element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank(),
                          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```

* Summer and autumn make up a relatively larger portion of the number, with the percentage of number held by spring, summer, autumn, winter, are 24%, 28.7%, 28.1%, and 19.2% respectively.

```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2019-11-01", date <= "2022-10-31") %>% group_by(season) %>% count(date) %>%
  mutate(year = case_when(date >= "2019-11-01" & date <= "2020-10-31" ~ "2019-11-01 ~ 2020-10-31",
                          date >= "2020-11-01" & date <= "2021-10-31" ~ "2020-11-01 ~ 2021-10-31",
                          date >= "2021-11-01" & date <= "2022-10-31" ~ "2021-11-01 ~ 2022-10-31")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = str_wrap(year,10), y = n, fill = season)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.8) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Daily number of bicycle theft by year",
       subtitle = "from 1st November 2019 to 31st October 2022",
       caption = "Data source: Stolen Bikes UK") +
  scale_x_discrete(expand=c(0, 0.4)) + scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,1), breaks = seq(0, 30, 5)) +
  theme_minimal() + theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "bottom",
                          plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
                          panel.grid = element_blank(),
                          panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 2, colour = "grey"),
                          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12))
```

* By separating the seasonal daily number into 3 years, it can be seen that seasonal differences are relatively smaller in the past two years.
* The winter time remains the lowest number in all years, while that in the summer and autumn in the first year are particularly higher.

### 4.1.3 Number of bicycle theft by month
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
stolen2 %>% filter(date >= "2019-11-01", date <= "2022-10-31") %>%
  count(month = month(date)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) +

colour_word[1:30,] %>% ggplot(aes(x = freq, y = fct_inorder(word), fill = freq)) + 
  geom_col() + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,

```

* Apparently black colour is the most popular in the thefts.
* But it is important to take into account that this may be just because more black colour bicycles exist in the country and it just reflects the popularity among the buyers but not the thieves.
* Combining data from the sales market is necessary for further verification.

## 4.4 Names of stolen bicycles
The names may provide information on the manufacturer, brand, model, or other relevant details.

### 4.4.1 names of stolen bicycle by word frequency
```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
bikename_word <- word_summary(stolen2$bike_name)

bikename_word[1:30,] %>% ggplot(aes(x = freq, y = fct_inorder(word), fill = freq)) + 
  geom_col() + scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("#2b5c8a", "goldenrod1", "#9e3d22")) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Names of stolen bicycles", subtitle = "most frequent words",
       caption = "Data source: Stolen Bikes UK", fill = "Frequency") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0, 0, 0, 50)) +
  theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = c(0.91, 0.795),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        panel.background =element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "grey"),
        panel.grid = element_blank(), panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "grey"),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(colour = "grey"))
```

* It is not surprising that some of the big bicycle brands are found in the list, with "Carrera" comes in first place, followed by "Specialized", "Trek", "Giant" and "Cannondale".
* For the bicycle type, "hybrid" is at a top rank. "Disc" may refer to disc brakes (compared to rim brakes, a type of brake technology in the wheel). "Mountain" and "sport" bicycle also appear as one of the most frequent words.

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=1.7, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
wordcloud2::wordcloud2(bikename_word)
```

* The wordcloud provides more figures on the less frequent words, with the size of each word relative to the number of frequency.
<br>
<br>

## 4.5 Description of stolen bicycles
More details of the stolen bicycles are provided in this section by the owners.

### 4.5.1 Description of stolen bicycle by word frequency
* Count the words in the "bike_des" column and omit some unrelated words that may appear.
```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=1.7, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
bike_word <- word_summary(stolen2$bike_des,
                          c("a", "and", "for", "the", "in", "was", "from", "to", "of", "on", "it",
                            "my", "at", "with", "unknown", "is", "", "or", "by", "be"), "[[:punct:]]")

wordcloud2::wordcloud2(bike_word)
```

* It can be seen that except the names and colours, more description on different parts such as "frame", "wheels", "saddle", "seat", "pedals", "handlebar", e.t.c. are found.
* Some bicycles may also have equipment like "bell", "sticker", and "lights", or special systems like "suspension" and "hydraulic".
<br>
<br>

## 4.6 Description of theft
Details of the thefts are also vital clues for recovering the bicycles.

### 4.6.1 Description of theft by word frequency
* Count the words in the "theft_des" column and omit some unrelated words that may appear.
```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=1.7, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
theft_word <- word_summary(stolen2$theft_des,
                           c("a", "and", "for", "the", "in", "was", "from", "to", "of", "on", "it",
                             "my", "at", "with", "unknown", "is", "", "or", "by", "be"), "[[:punct:]]")

wordcloud2::wordcloud2(theft_word, size = 1.5)
```

* Except the top words "bike" and "stolen", it seems many of the bicycles in the thefts were already "locked", "park" "outside" on the "road"/"street", near or in "garage"/"garden"/"house"/"building"/"station", but were being "cut", and higher chance at "morning", "night", or "overnight".
<br>
<br>

## 4.7 Average reward of bicycle recovery
Finally let's take a look on the average reward provided in different locations (If you want to be a bounty hunter :) )
```{r, warning=FALSE}
stolen2 %>% filter(reward_GBP >= 2e4) %>%  arrange(-reward_GBP) %>% print(n =Inf)
```

* It appears that some of the reward amounts are unusually large that they might be wrongly input, only values below GBP 20,000 are considered for the following visuals.


### 4.7.1 Average reward of bicycle recovery by regions
```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
library(packcircles)

reward_region <- (stolen2 %>% filter(reward_GBP < 2e4) %>% select(region, reward_GBP) %>% 
                    group_by(region) %>% summarize(average_reward = mean(reward_GBP),0))
packing2 <- circleProgressiveLayout(reward_region$average_reward, sizetype="area")
reward_region <- cbind(reward_region, packing2)
reward_region.gg <- circleLayoutVertices(packing2, npoints=50)
reward_region.gg$value <- rep(reward_region$average_reward, each = 51)

ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = reward_region.gg,
                        aes(x, y, group = id, fill = value),
                        colour = "grey") +
  geom_text(data = reward_region,
            aes(x, y, size = average_reward, label = str_wrap(region, 10)),
            colour = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(title = "Average reward of bicycle recovery by regions", fill = "Average\nreward\n(GBP)") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2.7287,4.5)) + theme_void() +
  theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.key.width = unit(5, "line")) +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("#2b5c8a", "chartreuse4", "darkgoldenrod1")) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("value"), size = "none")
```

* The range of average reward is not much, running from nearly GBP60 to more than GBP90.
* West Midlands (England) is at the top, London and South West (England) come afterwards.
<br>
<br>

### 4.7.2 Average reward of bicycle recovery by cities
```{r, fig.align='center', warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
reward_city <- (stolen2 %>% filter(reward_GBP < 2e4) %>% select(city, reward_GBP) %>% 
  group_by(city) %>% summarize(average_reward = mean(reward_GBP))) 
packing <- circleProgressiveLayout(reward_city$average_reward, sizetype="area")
reward_city <- cbind(reward_city, packing)
reward_city.gg <- circleLayoutVertices(packing, npoints=50)
reward_city.gg$value <- rep(reward_city$average_reward, each = 51)

ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = reward_city.gg,
                        aes(x, y, group = id, fill = value),
                        colour = "grey") +
  geom_text(data = reward_city,
            aes(x, y, size = average_reward, label = str_wrap(city, 10)),
            colour = "white", fontface = "bold") +
  labs(title = "Average reward of bicycle recovery by cities", fill = "Average\nreward\n(GBP)") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0.5,2.4)) + theme_void() +
  theme(text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 18),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.key.width = unit(5, "line")) +
  coord_equal() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("#2b5c8a", "chartreuse4", "darkgoldenrod1")) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("value"), size = "none")
```

* The range of average reward by cities is relatively higher, from no reward to GBP500 up. The top four cities are Monmouthshire (Wales), Denbighshire (Wales), Torfaen (Wales), and Scottish Borders (Scotland).

# 5. Key findings and conclusion
Community safety is always one of the vital concerns for people living there. It is encouraging to see the total number of bicycle thefts are dropping in the past three years. But there is the possibility that there may be correlation between this observation and the condition of fewer people who cycle to work due to more employers offering work-from-home to employees. 

Summer and autumn time are likely to have more stolen cases, and it usually comes to the greatest in September and October. Although the monthly figures of year 2022 are mostly lower than those in the previous two years, bicycle owners still should not take it lightly as it is observed that year 2022 is having a steady rising trend since June.

There is not really a distinctive "preference" for the thieves to commit a crime on any day of a week, with Monday and Saturday which could have up to 30 cases a day.

In terms of the geographical distribution, London is having the greatest amount of bicycle thefts, and Northern Ireland can be considered as the "safest" region.

Bicycles in black and blue colour are the most popular colours that are found in the thefts, while as mentioned earlier it may just reflect the popularity among the buyers but not the thieves. The rankings of the top 10 frequent colours in all regions are very similar.

Owners of bicycle brands “Carrera”, “Specialized”, “Trek”, “Giant” and “Cannondale” are relatively more often to be the victims. “Hybrid” and "disc" bicycles also frequently appeared in thefts.

In many cases the bicycles had already been locked but still being cut, which indicates owners may need to consider a strong type of lock or lock it in a safer location. Avoid parking the bicycles in the morning, night, or overnight, may also help to reduce the chance of being stolen.

With the aid of web scraping, up-to-date data could be obtained quickly for analysis. Bicycle theft is happening around us thus it is important to understand the situation. Hopefully this can help individuals or even the whole community to get to know the story behind the data and gain useful insight for making immediate decisions for any improvement.
